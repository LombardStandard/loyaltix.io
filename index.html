<p>
      The hospitality and hotel industry within the Asia-Pacific region is intensely competitive. While large incumbents from the US, such as Hyatt and Marriott, are in the market, so are regional competitors such as Lotte, Mandarin Oriental, and Nikko. All of these chains have one thing in common: a robust loyalty rewards ecosystem. Though each program is different, they all seek to encourage customer loyalty (thus lowering the Customer Acquisition Cost) by giving perks and discounts to repeat customers. This puts a small, independent hotel operator at a disadvantage. The large incumbent hotel chains and regional competitors have spent a vast amount of capital building out their loyalty rewards network. The major pain point the hospitality industry encounters with loyalty rewards programs is creating an effective Loyalty Rewards Ecosystem (LRE) as loyal customers will want to spend their points on more than hotel stays. This pain point stems from creating an effective network of vendors that accept the loyalty points as payment. Vendors may be skeptical to play a role in the LRE due to fears of late payment from the hotel chain for services provided. Lastly, there’s also the risk of hacks and fraud which escalate when external networks are involved. There are active Darknet Market communities selling fraudulently obtained LRE points. While a big hotel chain could withstand the added cost of this theft, it would be devastating for smaller chains.

Loyal customers are one of the primary drivers of any for-profit business. By building loyalty rewards programs, companies aim to heighten the customer experience through upgrades and discounts and to lower the Customer Acquisition Cost. In fact, enrolment in loyalty programs across various industries in the US grew by 20 % to 3.32b in 2015 from 2.65b just 3 years earlier, according to industry benchmarks, and more than tripled since 2000. Loyalty programs for hospitality. The hospitality sector in particular relies on reliable, repeat revenue from customers and therefore retaining customer loyalty is very important. In addition, loyal customers want to spend points not only on the hotel services or upgrades but also at movie theatres, retail stores or online shopping. The main appeal for customers is to access an effective network of hotel partners and services providers which beside identifying the operator’s brand, create attractiveness and higher experiences. For these reasons large hotel chains have spent a vast amount of capital for building out their the resources and network to establish a robust loyalty rewards program. This puts boutique and independent hotel operators at a disadvantage.

Definitions

* Blockchain: A blockchain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data.
* Public Chain: A blockchain that is accessible to the public. While data can be encrypted on this chain, all data can be inspected and verified by the public (even if one can’t see the specific data, a hash of the data can suffice as proof it was written).
* Private Chain: Blockchains that are private (or permissioned) work similarly to public blockchains but with access controls that restrict those that can join the network
* Smart Contract: A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties.
* Foreign Key: A foreign key is a field in one table of a database that uniquely identifies a row of another/same table.

Current challenges

Network and implementation costs. Traditionally loyalty schemes can be difficult to setup, expensive and resource intensive to operate. The success of a loyalty rewards program requires an effective network of vendors that accept the loyalty points as payment. Vendors may be skeptical to play a role due to fears of late reimbursement or risk of data manipulation. In addition, a significant amount of resources shall be in place to verify transactions.

Systems integrations and intermediaries. The lack a unified systems results in the need for complex integrations to be built between multiple different systems and parties which introduces cost and security risks. Further challenges arises because of the need of intermediaries such as banks and the cost associated.

Customer experience. From a customer experience perspective, the schemes are also often restrictive in terms of the flexibility of reward redemption which leads to low liquidity of loyalty points. Accounts inactivity, low redemption rates, overlapping offerings, approval processes, time delays and high transaction costs are resulting in a low client retention.

Liabilities on balance sheets. A major challenge for operators are the unclaimed rewards accounted as liabilities.

Blockchain solution

Reducing costs. Clear cost savings are identifiable on three major levels: system management, transactional, and customer acquisition. A blockchain-based loyalty rewards program should reduce the resources required for system management and accounting. In addition the user-friendly technology, the personalised mobile applications, and the integration with social media, should boost customer retention and reduce Customer Acquisition Costs.

Enabling a frictionless system. Through a decentralised technology solution, blockchain is centralising the customer’s loyalty programs. Loyalty providers decide how and with whom the customer uses these rewards, but from a consumer perspective, his/her ability to access and manage them is practically frictionless.

Making the process near real-time. Blockchain can enable a transaction to be recorded and accessed by multiple involved parties in near real time, increasing the chance that a loyalty rewards program provider can cut through coordination inertia to credit points faster. From a customer perspective this means an immediate and independent capability to earn and send the value of the accredited points, instead of incurring in delays and approval processes.

Providing a secure environment. Blockchain creates an immutable and time-stamped distributed database entry of every single transaction ever made, making each transaction and its record easily traceable, but also rendering them irreversible, preventing double spending, fraud, abuse, and any other type of manipulation of the transactions.

Creating unique business opportunities. A loyalty rewards program provider with a well-developed program will have unique opportunities to offer value-added services to other businesses.

Implementing a Blockchain-based LRE

The key advantage of a Blockchain-based LRE is the streamlining of the creation of a rewards network. The strength of the Blockchain is in its ability to create scalable, interconnected networks, where the data is mutually verifiable by all parties and preserved in a tamper resistant fashion. Where this helps the hospitality industry is the ability to deploy rewards networks to external vendors, allowing customers to spend points earned at the hotel elsewhere such as a retailer, movie theatre, or restaurant. Blockchain technology allows for the hotel to assign a specific monetary value to each point and have external vendors accept it at an agreed upon amount -- either at the initial value or lower. For instance, a luxury retailer could accept the points at a lower, deflated value, while a budget-oriented retailer could accept them at face value. All of this is done behind the scenes -- fully integrated into both parties’ Point of Sale (POS) and management systems -- providing a seamless experience for the customer and a headache-free point- cash reconciliation process for both parties’ accounting departments. This process works because of a system of public and private blockchains. The private blockchain would hold data regarding the rewards available from the specific vendor / hotels; the public blockchain would hold transaction data as well as quantities available of rewards. These two blockchains would reconcile via a smart contract whenever a customer makes a reward purchase. While this may sound complicated, the good news is the entire system is designed to be plug and play. It integrates fully into the hotel’s existing Hotel Management System (HMS) and Point of Sale system. Below are some screenshots of the system. Remember, the system is fully customizable and these screenshots are merely meant to be illustrative and not exhaustive.
