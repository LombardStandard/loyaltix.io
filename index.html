          <p>
            The hospitality industry in the Asia-Pacific region is highly competitive, with large international hotel chains competing alongside regional and local players. A key advantage for large incumbents is their robust rewards programs, designed to encourage customer loyalty by offering perks and discounts, ultimately reducing Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC). However, developing such programs presents significant challenges, particularly for smaller, independent hotels that lack resources and capital. <br><br>

            One of the primary difficulties in building a rewards program is the need for partnerships with external vendors that allow customers to obtain a higher experience by spending points beyond the hotel stay. Larger hotel chains can forge these partnerships with retail stores and entertainment venues, providing customers with greater flexibility in redeeming their points. Independent hotels, however, struggle to establish such networks, which puts them at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, rewards programs are increasingly susceptible to fraud, with Darknet Market communities actively selling stolen loyalty points. While large hotel chains can absorb the financial losses from fraud and hacking, smaller hotels are more vulnerable to the consequences, potentially facing significant financial and reputational harm. <br><br>

            As the industry evolves, smaller operators must find innovative ways to build customer loyalty without the extensive resources available to their larger competitors. <br>

        <section id="problem">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold pb-3">Problem</h3>
          <ul class="ml-5">
            <li><strong>Network and setup costs.</strong> Traditional loyalty programs are challenging to establish, requiring substantial investment and resources to manage. The effectiveness of these programs depends on building a network of vendors willing to accept loyalty points as currency. However, vendors may hesitate to participate due to concerns about delayed payments or the risk of data breaches. Additionally, considerable resources are needed to validate transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>System integration and intermediaries. </strong> The absence of standardized systems leads to the need for complex integration between various platforms and entities, increasing both costs and security risks. Further complications arise from the involvement of intermediaries such as banks, which add extra costs and complexity.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer satisfaction. </strong>From the customer's perspective, loyalty programs can be restrictive, offering limited flexibility in redeeming rewards, which reduces the usability of points. Inactive accounts, low redemption rates, overlapping rewards, lengthy approval processes, time delays, and high transaction fees all contribute to low customer retention.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance sheet liabilities.</strong> A significant issue for program operators is the accumulation of unredeemed rewards, which are recorded as liabilities on their balance sheets.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="solution">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold pb-3">Solution</h3>
          <ul class="ml-5">
            <li><strong>Lowering costs.</strong> Significant cost reductions are observable across three key areas: system management, transaction handling, and customer acquisition. A blockchain-driven loyalty rewards system can streamline system management and accounting processes. Furthermore, user-friendly technology, personalized mobile apps, and social media integration can enhance customer loyalty and lower the CAC.</li>
            <li><strong>Seamless system.</strong> Blockchain’s decentralized technology simplifies the management of loyalty programs for customers. While loyalty providers control how and where rewards are used, customers experience a seamless, easy-to-manage interface for accessing and utilizing their rewards.</li>
            <li><strong>Near-instant processes.</strong> Blockchain allows transactions to be recorded and shared with all involved parties almost instantly. This reduces delays and accelerates crediting of loyalty points. From a customer’s perspective, this means they can immediately earn and redeem points without waiting for approval or encountering delays.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure environment.</strong> Blockchain creates an unchangeable, time-stamped distributed ledger of every transaction, making each action traceable and irreversible. This helps prevent double spending, fraud, abuse, or any other tampering with loyalty program transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>New business opportunities.</strong> A well-executed blockchain-based loyalty program enables providers to offer unique value-added services to other businesses, unlocking new potential revenue streams and partnerships.</li>
          </ul>

        Implementing a Blockchain-based LRE

        The key advantage of a Blockchain-based LRE is the streamlining of the creation of a rewards network. The strength of the Blockchain is in its ability to create scalable, interconnected networks, where the data is mutually verifiable by all parties and preserved in a tamper resistant fashion. Where this helps the hospitality industry is the ability to deploy rewards networks to external vendors, allowing customers to spend points earned at the hotel elsewhere such as a retailer, movie theatre, or restaurant. Blockchain technology allows for the hotel to assign a specific monetary value to each point and have external vendors accept it at an agreed upon amount -- either at the initial value or lower. For instance, a luxury retailer could accept the points at a lower, deflated value, while a budget-oriented retailer could accept them at face value. All of this is done behind the scenes -- fully integrated into both parties’ Point of Sale (POS) and management systems -- providing a seamless experience for the customer and a headache-free point- cash reconciliation process for both parties’ accounting departments. This process works because of a system of public and private blockchains. The private blockchain would hold data regarding the rewards available from the specific vendor / hotels; the public blockchain would hold transaction data as well as quantities available of rewards. These two blockchains would reconcile via a smart contract whenever a customer makes a reward purchase. While this may sound complicated, the good news is the entire system is designed to be plug and play. It integrates fully into the hotel’s existing Hotel Management System (HMS) and Point of Sale system. Below are some screenshots of the system. Remember, the system is fully customizable and these screenshots are merely meant to be illustrative and not exhaustive.

        What is Quorum DLT?

        Quorum is an Ethereum based distributed ledger technology, another term for Blockchain. The objective behind this to provide a permissioned (private) implementation of Ethereum which supports transactions and contract privacy. Quorum is developed by JP Morgan as part of the bank’s research into ways Blockchain could improve transaction clearing and settlement. The platform is open source, and free to use.

        Quorum™ DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) is a private blockchain protocol developed by the American investment bank JP Morgan with the purpose of providing a permissioned and private implementation of Ethereum that supports transaction and contract privacy. Quorum™ DLT is ideal for any application requiring high speed and high throughput processing of private transactions within a permissioned group of known participants. Quorum™ DLT addresses specific challenges to blockchain technology adoption within the financial industry, and beyond.
