        <p>
          The hospitality industry in the Asia-Pacific region is highly competitive, with large international hotel chains competing alongside regional and local players. A key advantage for large incumbents is their robust rewards programs, designed to encourage customer loyalty by offering perks and discounts, ultimately reducing Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC). However, developing such programs presents significant challenges, particularly for smaller, independent hotels that lack resources and capital. <br><br>

One of the primary difficulties in building an effective loyalty program is the need for partnerships with external vendors that allow customers to obtain a higher experience by spending points beyond the hotel stay. Larger hotel chains can forge these partnerships with non-hospitality businesses, such as retail stores and entertainment venues, providing customers with greater flexibility in redeeming their points. Independent hotels, however, struggle to establish such networks, which puts them at a competitive disadvantage.

Moreover, loyalty programs are increasingly susceptible to fraud, with Darknet Market communities actively selling stolen loyalty points. While large hotel chains can absorb the financial losses from fraud and hacking, smaller hotels are more vulnerable to the consequences, potentially facing significant financial and reputational harm.

As the industry evolves, smaller operators must find innovative ways to build customer loyalty without the extensive resources available to their larger competitors.

          Definitions

          * Blockchain: A blockchain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data.
          * Public Chain: A blockchain that is accessible to the public. While data can be encrypted on this chain, all data can be inspected and verified by the public (even if one can’t see the specific data, a hash of the data can suffice as proof it was written).
          * Private Chain: Blockchains that are private (or permissioned) work similarly to public blockchains but with access controls that restrict those that can join the network
          * Smart Contract: A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties.
          * Foreign Key: A foreign key is a field in one table of a database that uniquely identifies a row of another/same table.

          Current challenges

          Network and implementation costs. Traditionally loyalty schemes can be difficult to setup, expensive and resource intensive to operate. The success of a loyalty rewards program requires an effective network of vendors that accept the loyalty points as payment. Vendors may be skeptical to play a role due to fears of late reimbursement or risk of data manipulation. In addition, a significant amount of resources shall be in place to verify transactions.

          Systems integrations and intermediaries. The lack a unified systems results in the need for complex integrations to be built between multiple different systems and parties which introduces cost and security risks. Further challenges arises because of the need of intermediaries such as banks and the cost associated.

          Customer experience. From a customer experience perspective, the schemes are also often restrictive in terms of the flexibility of reward redemption which leads to low liquidity of loyalty points. Accounts inactivity, low redemption rates, overlapping offerings, approval processes, time delays and high transaction costs are resulting in a low client retention.

          Liabilities on balance sheets. A major challenge for operators are the unclaimed rewards accounted as liabilities.

          Blockchain solution

          Reducing costs. Clear cost savings are identifiable on three major levels: system management, transactional, and customer acquisition. A blockchain-based loyalty rewards program should reduce the resources required for system management and accounting. In addition the user-friendly technology, the personalised mobile applications, and the integration with social media, should boost customer retention and reduce Customer Acquisition Costs.

          Enabling a frictionless system. Through a decentralised technology solution, blockchain is centralising the customer’s loyalty programs. Loyalty providers decide how and with whom the customer uses these rewards, but from a consumer perspective, his/her ability to access and manage them is practically frictionless.

          Making the process near real-time. Blockchain can enable a transaction to be recorded and accessed by multiple involved parties in near real time, increasing the chance that a loyalty rewards program provider can cut through coordination inertia to credit points faster. From a customer perspective this means an immediate and independent capability to earn and send the value of the accredited points, instead of incurring in delays and approval processes.

          Providing a secure environment. Blockchain creates an immutable and time-stamped distributed database entry of every single transaction ever made, making each transaction and its record easily traceable, but also rendering them irreversible, preventing double spending, fraud, abuse, and any other type of manipulation of the transactions.

          Creating unique business opportunities. A loyalty rewards program provider with a well-developed program will have unique opportunities to offer value-added services to other businesses.

          Implementing a Blockchain-based LRE

          The key advantage of a Blockchain-based LRE is the streamlining of the creation of a rewards network. The strength of the Blockchain is in its ability to create scalable, interconnected networks, where the data is mutually verifiable by all parties and preserved in a tamper resistant fashion. Where this helps the hospitality industry is the ability to deploy rewards networks to external vendors, allowing customers to spend points earned at the hotel elsewhere such as a retailer, movie theatre, or restaurant. Blockchain technology allows for the hotel to assign a specific monetary value to each point and have external vendors accept it at an agreed upon amount -- either at the initial value or lower. For instance, a luxury retailer could accept the points at a lower, deflated value, while a budget-oriented retailer could accept them at face value. All of this is done behind the scenes -- fully integrated into both parties’ Point of Sale (POS) and management systems -- providing a seamless experience for the customer and a headache-free point- cash reconciliation process for both parties’ accounting departments. This process works because of a system of public and private blockchains. The private blockchain would hold data regarding the rewards available from the specific vendor / hotels; the public blockchain would hold transaction data as well as quantities available of rewards. These two blockchains would reconcile via a smart contract whenever a customer makes a reward purchase. While this may sound complicated, the good news is the entire system is designed to be plug and play. It integrates fully into the hotel’s existing Hotel Management System (HMS) and Point of Sale system. Below are some screenshots of the system. Remember, the system is fully customizable and these screenshots are merely meant to be illustrative and not exhaustive.
